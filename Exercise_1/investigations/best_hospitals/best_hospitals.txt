What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?

In this analysis I used the 'Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv' flatfile that is loaded into Spark as a table called "effective_transform".

First I wrote a query to find the 10 hospitals with the highest average scores across the procedures they provide, but the list of hospitals returned has average scores that are much higher than 100. So I wrote another query to find procedures that are not scored on a scale of 0-100. I proceeded to remove those procedures, along with some other time-to-event measures (e.g. Left before being seen) and medians (e.g. Median Time to ECG) from the analysis. It is important to have scores on the same scale because we dont want any one of the procedures to have a greater effect on the aggregate than the other procedures. 

Next, I wrote  another query that was very similar to the one I wrote in the very beginning. This time, the average scores of the top hospitals are all =<100 as expected. However, some of these hospitals with very high scores only provide 1 procedure, which does not quite answer our question of "Which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures." Therefore I filtered my last query results to obtain a list of 10 hospitals with high average scores across at least 10 procedures, and I ended up with the table on the top of this page.
