Steps performed:

 - Cloned git repo
 - Changed directory to loading_and_modeling
 - Removed headers in each of the files
 - Renamed the files by removing spaces
 - Made new directories on HDFS
 - Moved the renamed files to HDFS 
 - Defined schema and created tables from said files

Note:
The "Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv" flatfile was too big to upload to GitHub, so I manually broke it up to 3 pieces.
